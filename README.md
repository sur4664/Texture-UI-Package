These are placeholder images, but structured exactly how a real asset folder should look — so you can simply replace them with real textures later.



Texture file  as
All set — I packaged a **Vercel-ready static site** for you.

👉 Download the ZIP: **[vercel_texture_site.zip](sandbox:/mnt/data/vercel_texture_site.zip)**

What I included:

* `public/index.html` — complete UI + texture selector + demo Three.js canvas.
* `public/styles.css` — UI styling.
* `public/script.js` — Three.js loader + basic texture-switching logic (loads Three.js from CDN).
* `public/textures/` — 7 placeholder texture images you can replace with real textures.
* `package.json` — scripts for local preview (`npx serve public -l 3000`).
* `vercel.json` — Vercel config to deploy the `public/` folder as a static site.
* `README.md` — deployment and usage instructions.

How to deploy to Vercel:

1. Unzip the project and open the folder.
2. (Optional) Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
3. Run `vercel` and follow prompts, or connect the folder's repo to Vercel via the Vercel dashboard.

   * Vercel will use `vercel.json` to deploy `public/` as a static site.

If you want, I can now:

* Replace placeholders with **high-res real textures** I select and include (I can fetch public-domain textures).
* Convert this to a full Next.js app with routing and React components.
* Add the completed Three.js full-featured viewer (PDF export, walkthrough recorder) into this project.
